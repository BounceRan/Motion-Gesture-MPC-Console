Motion & Gesture MPC Console is an interactive programming project. It is a body motion and gesture live music console. It is a design for perform live multitracks music.
In this project I use Myo to detect different arm motion and gesture. It will send all the motion data to a laptop. Then, An application on a laptop, which programmed in Max MSP, will process those data and select different music track to play. In the same time, there are 6 light bulbs which programmed in arduino, will also have interactive feedback to the gesture and motions. Those light bulbs are the visualization, which represent which track is now on the play. For instance, if first track is playing, the light bulb 1 will light up, else if first track is mute the light bulb 1 will turn off.
